* Cope with cropped scene elements?
  - It's possible to "crop" in the transform, or "crop/pad" as a filter, or add
    "crop" attributes to certain source types (incl window capture). Test all.
* Have a (one-shot? toggled?) way to grab an image from every source in the
  scene, thus giving a viable preview, not just a wireframe
  - Problematic with overlays - they're either going to show a constant image
    or stay permanently blank. Unideal in many other situations too.
* OBS-Studio b360168 added the ability to "lock volume". Check what that does.
  - Locked status is not transmitted by event. Should we (a) respect it, and
    (b) be able to toggle it?
* Make text not selectable in the scene switcher (it looks ugly and interferes
  with mobile defaults)
* Implement autoconnect. It's kinda done but not very much.
* Allow a layout to be marked as default

Grab CEF by using the same commands as in obs-studio/CI/install-dependencies-linux.sh
$ tar xjf cef_binary_4280_linux64.tar.bz2
$ mkdir cef_binary_4280_linux64/build; cd cef_binary_4280_linux64/build
$ cmake ..; make -j6

Not currently using PipeWire. Remove ENABLE_PIPEWIRE=OFF if that becomes an option.

To test a new build of OBS while live:
$ cd obs-studio/build
$ rm -rf *; cmake -DUNIX_STRUCTURE=1 -DBUILD_BROWSER=ON -DCEF_ROOT_DIR="../../cef_binary_4280_linux64" -DENABLE_PIPEWIRE=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/rosuav/tmp/obs ..
$ make -j6 && make install
$ cd obs-websocket/build
$ rm -rf *; cmake -DLIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/rosuav/obs-studio/libobs -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/rosuav/tmp/obs ..
$ make -j6 && make install
$ cd /home/rosuav/tmp/obs
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/rosuav/tmp/obs/lib bin/obs
$ cd /home/rosuav/obs-remote-volume; python3 -m http.server
